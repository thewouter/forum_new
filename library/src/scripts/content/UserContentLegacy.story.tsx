            Look Eve the facts you believe that led to your choice are wrong, you were misinformed which has led you to think that leaving the EU will be good for the country. Leaving the EU will be a disaster, it might be worth asking your brother that voted to remain to explain it to you, maybe you will be more willing to listen to him?</div>

            Well I would still vote to leave the EU.</div>

            <br>
            That's because you posted your most telling comment earlier. All this guff about worrying about judges in Brussels and financial contributions are just a smoke screen for your real issue of deciding who we let in. That's what all this whole brexit comes down to. Ill informed racists like you.</div>

            <br>
            Do you actually have reason to call the poster racist? Or are you just being nasty?</div>

            <br>
            I realise you're a leaver so will only pick and choose the facts you want to read and acknowledge but for the avoidance of doubt my reason is clearly stated in the very post of mine you have quoted</div>
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            What is your reason for panelling the poster "racist"? Have they said anything racist? I haven't seen it so since you are. Making the accusation you can explain why.</div>
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            I've already explained. Maybe you can put a different spin on "deciding who we let in the country"??</div>
